## Hi, I'm Garrett

 I'm currently a student at the University of Texas finishing up my Bachelor's degree in Economics.<br/>
 To enhance my Data Analyst skills, I've taken plenty of classes in statistics and data science/analysis.<br/>
 I also finished the Google Coursera Certificate in Data Analysis!

- I’m currently finishing a scraping project in python for the Texas Softball Team!
- I’m currently gaining insights through the book: Analyzing Baseball Data with R
- I would like to learn more about regression and predictive models
- Fun fact: I can name the capital of every country in the World...on a good day
